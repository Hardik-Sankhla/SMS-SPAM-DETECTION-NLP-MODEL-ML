# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION-NLP-MODEL-ML

## Project Title: SMS Detection ML Model

### Description
This repository hosts my project for SMS Detection, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for machine learning. The aim was to create an efficient ML model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or non-spam using Python. This project serves as a practical demonstration of NLP fundamentals in text analysis and classification.

### Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Detailed process of text cleaning, tokenization, and stemming.
- **Feature Engineering:** Utilization of CountVectorizer for effective feature extraction.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Application of confusion matrix for model assessment.

### Directory Structure
- `/data`: Contains the SMS dataset used for training and testing.
- `/scripts`: Holds Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

### Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `/scripts` directory.
3. Run `main.py` to execute the model development script.
4. Follow the instructions in the script for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
